1. migrate yml files (like `ansible/transfers.yml`) into templates
2. support for a single variable location. Now for example service port (i.e. `8001`) is in 
	+ `/colabo.space-infrastructure/provisioning/ansible/variables/services-list.json` and in 
	+ `colabo.space-infrastructure/provisioning/ansible/variables/nginx-list.json`
