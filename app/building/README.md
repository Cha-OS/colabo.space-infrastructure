# Preloader

It goes directly into `index.html` inside the main app tag that will be replaced with generated app when it gets initially rendered. It has also styles that should be added directly in the index.html as well

# Reload button

It goes directly into `index.html`. It has also script code that should be added directly in the index.html as well

# Version

It goes directly into `index.html`. It is `v*` as default, and it has to be **manually** (as far as I remember) set each time after building the app.
